# Socket_Using_Go
Sockets created using GoLang

This project involves four primary parts:

1. To create a client and server using Go and exchange messages between them. The throughput in bytes and the bandwidth are calculated for Server-Client Communications with the calculations done at the server.
2. The maximum number of threads that can be active at a time are calculated.
3. The Server is multithreaded with multiple clients running the same code and the effect on bandwidth is measured.
4. A delay is introduced between the client and server to measure the effects on the connection.
